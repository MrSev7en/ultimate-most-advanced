# Ultimate Most Advanced - Console Version
üî∞ A advanced console for windows users, with a lot functions. Of course is not finished, but I guess I wanna keep working at that.
Coming Soon updates will come.

## Description
üíª Ultimate Most Advanced or U.M.A, started when I tried to use Windows Command Prompt, to make HTTP's Request... How you thinking.. Not worked.
So, I created this and have a lot functions, like:

- Web HTTP request.
- IP Address request.
- Socket IP Send, with prefab words selected by user.
- Multicore threads sending.
- And more functions.

üöß Warning, when you wanna send a prefab word to IP Address or Web HTTP Request, split the words with **_** or **-**, or not will work. Other thing, the Web HTTP Request, works with HTTPS too.
